"""Straight-track races, 8 runners, Rung 2 brain (assets/scene_track8.xml). Mirror of Unity TrackRaceEvent.

  dash      (8  The 30m Dash)          sprint 30 m from standstill; rank by finish time
  terminal  (19 Terminal Velocity)     open 84.39 m sprint (back straight) at the maximum trained command; rank by peak 1 s speed.
                                       Lane break (crowd rule, 2026-09-30; pack rule 2026-10-12): past BREAK_X the
                                       field squeezes to the inside (lane 1 = the runner's left): every runner lines up
                                       shoulder to shoulder with the runners alongside it (pack_target; two MATTs
                                       0.61 m apart), merging at most MERGE_DEG off straight
  brake     (22 Emergency Brake)       run in at BRAKE_VX, each runner brakes (command 0) when its pelvis is BRAKE_TRIGGER
                                       metres before the red line; must stop without crossing it (toe past the line =
                                       DQ); rank by the gap left to the line
  inverted  (9  The Inverted Sprint)   20 m backwards (runners face away from the finish: the finish is at x = -20 in the
                                       runner's frame; Unity turns the stadium 180 deg); leaving the lane (|y| > half a
                                       lane) = DQ, a fall = out; rank by finish time
  resurrection (27 The Resurrection Dash) start flat on the back (feet towards the finish), rise and sprint 5 m; the
                                       get-up brain drives from the gun (`recover`: a body without one stays down = DNF);
                                       falling again = down again, not out; rank by finish time
  steeple   (13 Steeplechase Jog)      50 m at 3.5 m/s with the flight brain (MATT: r2f_v3_it100); scored on GROUND
                                       TIME = finish time - hang time (total of the flights, both feet off the ground
                                       for >= MIN_FLIGHT): the clock only runs while a foot touches the track; a fall =
                                       out; rank by ground time, then finish time
  ramp      (14 The Alpine Ramp)       9 m up a 15 deg ramp with the slope brain (Rung4-Slope15); the ramp is the flat
                                       track with gravity tilted by 15 deg (x = distance along the ramp; Unity draws the
                                       scene tilted); a fall = out; rank by finish time
Runners steer with the contract's lane keeping (contract.steer_yaw_rate); traits as in the Iron Pedestal heat.

Fall recovery (opt-in, `recover` = body -> get-up brain; Unity TrackRaceEvent.recoverFromFalls): a runner whose body has
a get-up brain is not out when it falls. It first lies still in the default joint pose for RELAX_S (the tumble ends
and the body is in the pose the get-up brain was trained from), then the get-up brain runs (zero command) until the
pelvis is back above UP_Z x its standing height with the torso within UP_TILT_DEG for UP_HOLD_S, then the race brain
runs on. Still down RETRY_S after lying still: lie still and try again (the brain can lock into a propped pose), each
time RELAX_STEP_S longer (a retry from the same pose repeats the same failure), up to RELAX_MAX_STEPS steps.
Falls are counted (RaceLane.falls); a runner cannot finish while down. Not in the brake event. Shared with the slalom.
